=head1 NAME

File::Counter - Persistent counter class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use File::Counter;
 $c = new File::Counter "COUNTER", "aa00";

 $id = $c->inc;
 open(F, ">F$id");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a persistent counter class.  Each counter is
represented by a separate file in the file system.  You give the file
name as a parameter to the object constructor.  The file is created if
it does not exist.

If the file name does not start with "/" or ".", then it is
interpreted as a file relative to C<$File::Counter::DEFAULT_DIR>.  You
might pass a second parameter to the constructor, that sets the
initial value for a new counter.  This parameter only takes effect
when the file is created (i.e. it does not exist before the call).

Each time you call the C<inc> method, you increment the counter value.
The new value is returned.

=head1 BUGS

It uses flock(2) to lock the counter file.  This does not always
work.  Perhaps it should use the File::Lock module.
